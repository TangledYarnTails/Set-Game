# Set Game
A silly web version of the card game "Set!"

## Motivation
I wanted to create a more appealing version of the Card Game "Set!". I play this game on my phone a lot however the apps that I used to play were very grey, dull, and boring to look at. It was a game and yet the vibe and aesthetic just weren't giving off "Hey this game is really fun come try and play!" So, I wanted to create an inviting version of the game.
## How to Play
Each card has:
- Shape (pill, chevron diamond)
- Color (red, green, blue)
- Number (1, 2, or 3)
- Shading (solid, striped, open)
A SET is 3 cards where, for each feature, the cards are:
- all the same OR all different
- If two match and one doesn’t — not a set!
- Click on the cards to take the set
- Keep going! Until you find all the sets! There a total of 81 cards availabler per round.
- Game ends when no more sets.
## Features
Distrsibution doughnut chart Updates as the game progresses, displays what kinds of sets have been taken by the user.

| Category | Description | 
|---|---|
| Almost identical | everything same except one attribute |
| Balanced | two attributes match, two vary |
| Single common trait | one common trait |
| Rainbow Sets | all attributes are different|

Googly eyes follow mouse:
I felt the need to add something goofy to the experience so a vector is drawn between the pupils in every eye and the mouse, to make for a fun googly eye effect.
## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Chart.js
## To-Do -- when I learn more about coding
  - Create an online mode to play with friends
  - Create a "versus AI" mode to make the current practice mode more engaging
